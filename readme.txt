The main python files 'flask_app.py','Ratings.py', 'Recommendations.py' and 'Authenticate.py' read data from json files that I generated using programs 'sample.py', 'sample2.py', 'sample3.py','sample4.py'.

Since the json files was larger than the size limit allowed for github, I was not able to upload the json files.

So I uploaded the python files which generate these json files. 

I request you to download the dataset from yelp and place above python files in the same folder and run 'sample.py', 'sample2.py','sample3.py','sample4.py' python files prior to running the other python files or viewing the web application locally.

Viewing the web application locally would only happen if there is some problem on the link that I provided which is hosting the application.

In order to view the web application locally you will need to install flask. Anaconda already has flask installed, so if you use Anaconda, you will not need to install flask.You will have to run the file 'flask_app.py' to view the web application locally and then type 'localhost:5000/login' on your browser.
